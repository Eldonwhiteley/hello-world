This repository is for practicing Github flow.

I'm Eldon\
I am a second year Computer System Engineering student at Boise State University.\
I play video games in my free time and do a bit of programming from time to time.\
One of my favorite hobbies is putting together custom computers, I'm hoping to build a custom water loop sometime.
